                    <h3>Project Objective</h3>
                    <p>The objective of this project is to develop a finance app that will allow freelancers, clients and employers to receive and make payments easily and securely.

                    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                    <p>
                    In many parts of Africa, receiving payments from abroad is a major challenge for both employees and freelancers. The lack of reliable and accessible payment methods has resulted in a significant barrier for those seeking to receive payments from clients and employers outside of their country. The absence of a widely accepted and trusted payment platform, such as PayPal, has further compounded this issue, leaving many without a reliable and secure option for receiving payments.

                <p>In conclusion, the development of a finance app for receiving payments from freelance platforms, clients, and employers in Africa has been a challenging yet exciting project. We began by identifying the problem of limited payment accessibility in Africa, conducting research, and gathering user feedback to understand the needs and expectations of our target audience.
                <br><br>
                We then moved on to the critical stages of brainstorming ideas, designing a wireframe, and adding visual details to create a comprehensive and user-friendly platform. Through collaboration and a commitment to innovation, we have developed a solution that has the potential to revolutionize the way payments are received in Africa, and contribute to the growth and development of the continent.
                <br><br>
                As we move forward with the development and implementation of the platform, we remain committed to our core values of reliability, accessibility, and user-friendliness. We are confident that our approach will enable us to create a platform that meets the needs of our target audience, and we look forward to the positive impact it will have on individuals and businesses in Africa.
                <br><br>
                <strong>We are grateful for the opportunity to work on such an important project and look forward to making a meaningful contribution to the financial landscape of Africa.</strong>
